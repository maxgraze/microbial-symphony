export const explanation = `Imagine if you could hear the tiny, unseen microbes all around us. What would they sound like? With Microbial Symphony, that's exactly what I've sought to explore. I've taken data from [Michael Gänzle](https://research.ucalgary.ca/amr/people/investigators/michael-gaenzle) and his [Periodic Table of Fermented Food](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-022-11909-y), and simplified the primary microorganisms involved in each fermented food into five groups. When these microbes come together, they create a new sound, just as they produce new flavours when they ferment food.
Creating these sounds was a challenge, especially as this was one of my first experiences with sound design. I wanted to reflect the unique characteristics of each type of microbe. For instance, acetic acid bacteria, known for making vinegar, have a 'lively' sound, reflecting the sharp taste of their product.
On the other hand, molds, which form complex networks, have a more unpredictable sound, echoing the random way spores shoot up. I've tried to create a pleasing, harmonious experience, just like the delicious results of successful fermentation.

It's my hope that this project will help people see microbes as friends, not foes, and appreciate the vital role they play in our world. After all, without them, we wouldn't have many of our favourite foods – not to mention a healthy environment to live in. Just as musicians unite to create a symphony, microbes come together to produce a flavorful product that, like music, touches your soul with its complexity.
